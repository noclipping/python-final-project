### ðŸŽ¯ 1. Project Overview

This step is designed to lay a solid foundation for the project by clearly defining the goals, scope, and setup required to build a dynamic data visualization application as a solo developer.

#### Step 1.1: Define the Project Objectives

- **Objective**: Develop a web application that can scrape data from a chosen website, store this data in a PostgreSQL database, manipulate it with Pandas, visualize it with Matplotlib, and serve the visualizations via a Flask API.
- **Purpose**: To provide an interactive, real-time visualization tool that can assist in data-driven decision-making in various domains based on the scraped data.

#### Step 1.2: Select Data Source

- Decide on a website to scrape for data. This could be weather data, financial statistics, social media metrics, or any other publicly available data that interests you.
- Ensure the chosen website allows scraping (check `robots.txt` and terms of service).

#### Step 1.3: Tools and Technologies

Outline the tools and technologies to be used for different components of the project:

- **Web Scraping**: Python, Requests, BeautifulSoup
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (hosted on Neon.tech)
- **Data Processing**: Python, Pandas
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib
- **API Development**: Flask
- **Deployment**: Render

#### Step 1.4: Plan the Development Phases

Structure the development into clear phases, with goals for each stage:

- **Phase 1**: Setup and Web Scraping
  - Set up the development environment and necessary tools.
  - Develop the web scraping module to collect data from the chosen source.
- **Phase 2**: Database and Data Processing
  - Design and create the PostgreSQL database schema.
  - Implement data cleaning and manipulation with Pandas.
- **Phase 3**: Visualization and API Development
  - Create data visualizations using Matplotlib.
  - Develop the Flask API to serve visualizations dynamically.
- **Phase 4**: Deployment and Testing
  - Deploy the application on Render.
  - Perform functional and performance testing.
- **Phase 5**: Documentation
  - Document the setup, usage, and functionality of the application.

#### Step 1.5: Set Milestones

Define key milestones to track progress and keep the project on schedule:

- **Milestone 1**: Completion of web scraping module.
- **Milestone 2**: Database setup and initial data processing.
- **Milestone 3**: First visualization and API endpoint developed.
- **Milestone 4**: Successful deployment on Render.
- **Milestone 5**: Comprehensive documentation and project wrap-up.

### ðŸš€ Kickoff

With a clear project outline and development roadmap, you're now ready to begin the hands-on development, ensuring that all components integrate smoothly to build a functional and effective visualization tool. This structured approach will help maintain focus and efficiency, ensuring steady progress towards the project goals.
