### ðŸŒŒ 7. Serving Images through Flask

This step focuses on modifying the Flask API to serve images generated by Matplotlib directly to the client, as described previously but was mislabeled.

#### Step 7.1: Set Up Flask Routes for Visualization Serving

```python
@app.route('/temperature_trends')
def temperature_trends():
    # Generate and save the plot to a bytes buffer
    buf = io.BytesIO()
    create_temperature_plot().savefig(buf, format='png')
    buf.seek(0)

    # Send the buffer as a response
    return send_file(buf, mimetype='image/png')
```

Here, `create_temperature_plot()` is a function you would define that creates a Matplotlib figure based on the latest data.

#### Step 7.2: Dynamic Data Handling

Modify the endpoint to fetch real-time data from the database before generating the plot.

```python
def create_temperature_plot():
    df = fetch_latest_data(db_connection)  # fetch_latest_data is a hypothetical function
    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    ax.plot(df['date'], df['temperature'], marker='o')
    return fig
```

#### Step 7.3: Test and Deploy

Test these endpoints locally and then in your deployed environment to ensure they work as expected.

```bash
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

By separating these functionalities clearly, we ensure that Step 6 focuses on data-saving features while Step 7 covers how images are dynamically generated and served. This organization should help align the project steps more accurately with the requirements.
