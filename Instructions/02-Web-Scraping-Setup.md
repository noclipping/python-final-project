### üåê 2. Web Scraping Setup

In this section, we will set up the web scraping functionality to extract weather data from the National Weather Service website. We'll be using Python's `requests` library to fetch web pages and `BeautifulSoup` from bs4 to parse the HTML content.

#### Step 2.1: Install Required Libraries

Before you start scraping, you need to ensure that you have all the necessary Python libraries installed. Run the following commands in your terminal to install `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`.

```bash
pip install requests
pip install beautifulsoup4
```

#### Step 2.2: Fetch the Web Page

Create a Python script to fetch the content of the web page from which you want to scrape data. Here, we'll target a specific weather forecast page.

```python
import requests

def fetch_weather_page(url):
    response = requests.get(url)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.text
    else:
        raise Exception(f"Failed to fetch web page. Status code: {response.status_code}")

# Example usage
url = "https://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lat=37.7772&lon=-122.4168"
page_content = fetch_weather_page(url)
```

#### Step 2.3: Parse HTML Content with BeautifulSoup

Once you have the HTML content of the page, use `BeautifulSoup` to parse it and extract the necessary data.

```python
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

def parse_weather_data(html_content):
    soup = BeautifulSoup(html_content, 'html.parser')
    # Modify the selector based on the data you need
    forecast_items = soup.find_all('div', class_='tombstone-container')
    weather_data = []
    for item in forecast_items:
        period = item.find('p', class_='period-name').get_text()
        short_desc = item.find('p', class_='short-desc').get_text()
        temp = item.find('p', class_='temp').get_text()
        weather_data.append({'period': period, 'short_desc': short_desc, 'temp': temp})
    return weather_data

# Example usage
weather_data = parse_weather_data(page_content)
print(weather_data)
```

#### Step 2.4: Test and Validate Data Extraction

Ensure that your scraping script correctly extracts and prints the desired data. It's important to regularly check the website's structure as changes could break your script.

```python
# This block is part of the testing process you would run to verify your output
for data_point in weather_data:
    print(data_point)
```

#### Step 2.5: Handling Changes and Errors

Web pages can change, which might break your script. Implement error handling to manage these changes gracefully and send alerts if the scraping fails.

```python
try:
    page_content = fetch_weather_page(url)
    weather_data = parse_weather_data(page_content)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

### üöÄ Next Steps

Now that you've successfully set up web scraping to collect weather data, you can proceed to the next part of your project, which involves setting up the database to store this data. We'll cover that in the next set of instructions.

This step-by-step guide ensures you understand each part of the web scraping process and provides a robust foundation for collecting data for your project.
