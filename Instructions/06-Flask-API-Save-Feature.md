### ðŸš€ Flask API Development for Weather Data

This revision will take into account the structure of your weather data and include steps for using `dotenv` to manage environment variables.

#### Step 6.1: Setup Environment

Install the necessary Python packages if not already installed. You'll need `Flask`, `psycopg2`, and `python-dotenv`.

```bash
pip install Flask psycopg2-binary python-dotenv
```

#### Step 6.2: Use dotenv for Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in your project directory where you can store your database credentials safely.

```plaintext
# .env file
DATABASE_URL=postgres://yourusername:yourpassword@yourhost:yourport/yourdbname
```

Make sure to add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file to keep your credentials secure.

```plaintext
# .gitignore
.env
```

#### Step 6.3: Configure Flask and Database Connection

Update your Flask application to load environment variables from the `.env` file and establish a database connection.

```python
from flask import Flask, jsonify
import psycopg2
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()  # This is to load your environment variables from .env file

app = Flask(__name__)

def get_db_connection():
    conn = psycopg2.connect(os.environ['DATABASE_URL'])
    return conn
```

#### Step 6.4: API Route to Fetch Current Week's Weather Data

Define a Flask route that queries your PostgreSQL database for the latest weather data entries.

```python
@app.route('/weather', methods=['GET'])
def get_weather():
    conn = get_db_connection()
    cur = conn.cursor()
    # Assuming 'scraped_at' is storing the datetime of when the data was scraped
    cur.execute("""
        SELECT id, period, short_desc, temperature, scraped_at
        FROM weather_forecasts
        WHERE scraped_at >= current_date - INTERVAL '1 week'
        ORDER BY scraped_at DESC;
    """)
    weather_data = cur.fetchall()
    cur.close()
    conn.close()

    # Prepare the data for JSON response
    columns = ['id', 'period', 'short_desc', 'temperature', 'scraped_at']
    result = [dict(zip(columns, row)) for row in weather_data]

    return jsonify(result)
```

This API endpoint `/weather` will return all weather data entries from the past week, which helps users understand recent weather trends.

#### Step 6.5: Run and Test the API

Make sure your Flask application runs correctly and is ready for local testing.

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

Test the API locally by visiting `http://127.0.0.1:5000/weather` in your browser or using a tool like Postman. Verify that the response correctly includes the structured data for the past week's weather.

### Enhancements and Considerations

- **Error Handling**: Add error handling around database operations to manage potential disconnections or errors gracefully.
- **Response Formatting**: Consider formatting temperatures and dates in the API response to improve readability and consistency for users.

This setup uses `dotenv` to securely manage your environment variables and tailors the database query and API response to suit the format and structure of your weather data. This approach will ensure that your Flask API is robust, secure, and practical for serving real-world data efficiently.
