### 🎯 1. Project Overview

- **Objective**: Create a web application that scrapes, visualizes, and allows users to save data via a Flask API.
- **Tools and Technologies**:
  - Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Flask, BeautifulSoup for scraping)
  - PostgreSQL on Neon.tech
  - Render for deploying the Flask API

### 🌐 2. Web Scraping Setup

- **Task**: Scrape weather data from the National Weather Service website.
- **Details**:
  - Use Python’s `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` libraries to scrape weather forecasts.
  - Example URL: `https://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lat=37.7772&lon=-122.4168`.

### 🗃️ 3. Database Setup

- **Task**: Set up and configure the PostgreSQL database on Neon.tech.
- **Details**:
  - Design and create database schema suitable for storing scraped weather data, user settings, and saved visualizations.
  - Establish database connections and authentication securely.

### 📊 4. Data Manipulation with Pandas

- **Task**: Write Python scripts to process and prepare data for visualization.
- **Details**:
  - Use Pandas to clean and transform scraped data into a usable format for analysis.

### 📉 5. Data Visualization with Matplotlib

- **Task**: Develop Python scripts to create visualizations from the processed data.
- **Details**:
  - Generate charts such as line graphs and bar charts to represent the weather trends visually.

### 🚀 6. Flask API Development with Save Feature

- **Task**: Create a Flask API to serve and save the data and visualizations.
- **Details**:
  - Develop endpoints that perform data processing, return visualizations, and handle data saving requests based on user input (e.g., `?save=true`).
  - Implement SQL operations for INSERT and UPDATE to manage user data and visualizations in the PostgreSQL database.

### 🌌 7. Serving Images through Flask

- **Task**: Configure Flask to serve images dynamically.
- **Details**:
  - Implement routes that create and stream images directly to the client without intermediate file storage.

### 🛠️ 8. Deployment on Render

- **Task**: Deploy the Flask application to Render.
- **Details**:
  - Prepare the application for deployment, including environment setup and deployment configuration.

### 🧪 9. Testing and Validation

- **Task**: Ensure the full system works as intended.
- **Details**:
  - Conduct thorough testing of web scraping, data processing, visualization generation, API responsiveness, and database interactions.

### 📝 10. Documentation and Final Submission

- **Task**: Document the entire project process and setup.
- **Details**:
  - Write comprehensive documentation covering how to set up the project, run the API, and interact with the system. Include examples of saving and retrieving data.
