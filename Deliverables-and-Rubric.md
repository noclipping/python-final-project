#### üìã Project Deliverables

This section outlines all items that must be completed and submitted by the end of the project.

1. **Web Scraping Module**:

   - A functional Python script that can scrape data from a chosen website.
   - Data should be relevant to the goals of the project and must adhere to the website‚Äôs scraping policy.

2. **Database Setup**:

   - A PostgreSQL database hosted on Neon.tech with a schema appropriate for the scraped data.
   - Documentation on the database schema and any setup instructions.

3. **Data Processing Scripts**:

   - Python scripts using Pandas to clean and transform the scraped data into a usable format.

4. **Data Visualization**:

   - At least two different types of visualizations created using Matplotlib based on the processed data.

5. **Flask API**:

   - A fully functional Flask API that serves the data visualizations dynamically.
   - The API must handle different types of requests and serve the visualizations as image responses.

6. **Deployment**:

   - The complete application must be deployed on Render and accessible via a public URL.

7. **Documentation**:

   - A comprehensive README file that includes setup, usage, and API documentation.
   - Inline comments and docstrings in the code for clarity and maintainability.

8. **Testing**:
   - Evidence of thorough testing, including unit tests for the scraper and API routes.
   - Any test scripts or Postman collections used for testing the API.

#### üìù Evaluation Criteria

Each component of the project will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

1. **Functionality**:

   - Completeness: All deliverables are implemented and functional.
   - Correctness: Deliverables correctly perform the tasks as intended.

2. **Quality**:

   - Code Quality: Code is clean, well-organized, and free of bugs.
   - Visualization Quality: Visualizations are clear, accurate, and effectively convey the intended data insights.

3. **Usability**:

   - User Experience: The API is easy to use and well-documented.
   - Accessibility: The application is easily accessible via the web.

4. **Creativity and Innovation**:
   - Shows creative use of technology and original thinking in the application‚Äôs implementation and problem-solving.

#### üéØ Grading Rubric

| Deliverable             | Exceeds Expectations (90-100%)                                          | Meets Expectations (70-89%)                                       | Below Expectations (50-69%)                                      | Fails (Below 50%)                                   |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Web Scraping Module     | Scrapes data efficiently without errors and respects site‚Äôs terms.      | Adequately scrapes data with minor issues.                        | Scrapes data but with significant issues or inefficiencies.      | Does not function or violates scraping policies.    |
| Database Setup          | Database is optimally structured and well-documented.                   | Database is functional but could be optimized.                    | Database setup is flawed or poorly documented.                   | Database is not usable or not set up.               |
| Data Processing Scripts | Data is exceptionally well-processed with advanced techniques.          | Data is adequately processed.                                     | Data processing is minimal or incorrect.                         | No data processing is apparent or very poorly done. |
| Data Visualization      | Creates insightful, well-designed visualizations.                       | Visualizations are adequate but lack some detail or clarity.      | Visualizations are poorly constructed and not very useful.       | Fails to produce visualizations.                    |
| Flask API               | API is robust, handles all errors gracefully, and is well-documented.   | API functions correctly with minor issues.                        | API has significant issues but is somewhat functional.           | API is non-functional or missing.                   |
| Deployment              | Application is fully deployed with no downtime and fast response times. | Application is deployed but has minor issues like slow responses. | Application deployment has significant problems affecting usage. | Application is not deployed.                        |
| Documentation           | Documentation is exceptionally clear, thorough, and well-organized.     | Documentation is adequate but could be more detailed.             | Documentation is insufficient and unclear.                       | Documentation is missing or very poor.              |
| Testing                 | Comprehensive testing is documented and covers all features.            | Adequate testing is done but lacks some coverage.                 | Minimal testing is evident, missing many features.               | No testing is evident.                              |

### üöÄ Conclusion
